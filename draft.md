-   25 years ago: a leading discipline
-   today: largely absent?

Latent pattern recognition:

-    topic modelling
-    embedded laten patte

---

Good and bad reasons

-   corpus size
-   tolerance for imprecise editions
-   morphological complexity



---

# Limitations of current standards


-   ISO 639* family: Greek dialects not recognized
-   Unicode:
    -   language and script conflated
    -   epichoric scripts not recognized
    -   confusion of multivalent and contradictory glyphs

historical language: corpus-linguistic perspective

for a given corpus:

-    unique lexicon
-    unique set of inflectional rules


---

what makes Greek?

shared analytical forms


---

"Analysis by synthesis" algorithm



---

FSA not expressive enough for Greek morphology

crossing of lexical and inflectional properties of Greek accent cannot be reduced to context-free state transitions

---

A simple worked example

Andocides *On the Mysteries* 1.96

> Νόμος. ἔδοξε τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ.

IG 1.3, 156
